# Kitex Release Script
#
# This script creates a new release tag for the Kitex project.
# It performs the following steps:
#   1. Validates you're on the main branch and up-to-date with origin
#   2. Prompts for the target commit to release
#   3. Shows changes since the last version
#   4. Allows you to choose version bump type (major/minor/patch)
#   5. Validates version.go matches the new version
#   6. Creates and pushes the release tag
#
# Usage:
#   ./release.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Must be on main branch
#   - Local repo must be up-to-date with origin
#   - Target commit must exist on origin
#
# The script will interactively prompt for:
#   - Target commit hash to release
#   - Version bump type (patch/minor/major)
#   - Confirmation before creating the tag
#
