# Kitex Hotfix Release Script
#
# This script creates hotfix releases for specific minor versions.
# It performs the following steps:
#   1. Prompts for the minor version to create a hotfix for (e.g., v0.14.x)
#   2. Finds the latest patch version for that minor version
#   3. Creates or uses existing hotfix branch from the latest patch
#   4. Shows changes in the hotfix branch
#   5. Creates and pushes a new patch version tag
#
# Usage:
#   ./release-hotfix.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Git repository must be fetched with latest changes
#   - Hotfix branch must exist (script can create it if needed)
#   - Hotfix commits must be on origin
#
# The script will interactively prompt for:
#   - Minor version to hotfix (e.g., v0.14.x)
#   - Confirmation to create hotfix branch (if it doesn't exist)
#   - Confirmation before creating the hotfix tag
#
# Example workflow:
#   1. Run script and specify v0.14.x
#   2. Script creates v0.14.x-hotfix branch from latest v0.14.* tag
#   3. Create PR with hotfix changes to the hotfix branch
#   4. Run script again to create the hotfix release
#
